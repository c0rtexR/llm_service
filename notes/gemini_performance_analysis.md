# Gemini Performance Analysis

## Current Performance Profile

### Single Request Performance
- Short prompts: ~890ms
- Medium prompts: ~4.5s
- Long prompts: ~6.1s
- Reliability: Good for single requests

### Throughput Performance
- Sequential throughput: ~0.48 requests/second
- Token throughput: Not measurable (Gemini doesn't provide token counts)
- Rate limiting: Hits 429 errors at >0.5 req/s

### Concurrent Load Performance
- Maximum concurrent requests: 2
- Success rate: Poor (0/4 in latest test)
- Primary bottleneck: Rate limiting

## Main Problems

1. **Rate Limiting Issues**
   - Problem: Aggressive rate limiting by Gemini API
   - Impact: Cannot achieve true concurrent processing
   - Current mitigation: Exponential backoff with 3 retries
   
   Potential Solutions:
   - Implement token bucket rate limiting
   - Add request queuing with prioritization
   - Use multiple API keys with round-robin selection
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern

2. **Request Coordination**
   - Problem: No coordination between concurrent requests
   - Impact: Multiple retries waste API quota
   - Current mitigation: Conservative concurrent limits
   
   Potential Solutions:
   - Implement centralized request scheduler
   - Add adaptive rate limiting based on success/failure
   - Use sliding window rate limiter
   - Add request coalescing for similar prompts

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Problem: Limited visibility into token usage
   - Impact: Cannot optimize token throughput
   - Current mitigation: None
   
   Potential Solutions:
   - Implement token estimation
   - Add detailed performance metrics
   - Create real-time monitoring dashboard
   - Set up alerts for rate limit hits

4. **Error Handling**
   - Problem: Basic retry mechanism
   - Impact: Not optimal for all error types
   - Current mitigation: Simple exponential backoff
   
   Potential Solutions:
   - Add error categorization
   - Implement different strategies per error type
   - Add circuit breaker for persistent errors
   - Improve error reporting and tracking

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Implement token bucket rate limiting
2. Add request queuing with timeout
3. Improve error categorization and handling
4. Add basic monitoring metrics

### Medium Term
1. Implement request scheduler
2. Add multiple API key support
3. Create monitoring dashboard
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern

### Long Term
1. Add adaptive rate limiting
2. Implement request coalescing
3. Create advanced analytics
4. Add predictive scaling

## Performance Targets

### Realistic Targets
- Single request latency: <1s for short prompts
- Throughput: 0.5 req/s sustained
- Concurrent requests: 2-3 with queuing
- Error rate: <5% after retries

### Stretch Goals
- Throughput: 2 req/s with multiple API keys
- Concurrent requests: 5-10 with queuing
- Error rate: <1% after retries

## Next Steps

1. Implement token bucket rate limiting
2. Add request queuing system
3. Improve monitoring and metrics
4. Test with multiple API keys
5. Set up performance monitoring

## Notes

- Gemini's rate limits appear to be more aggressive than documented
- Need to balance between throughput and reliability
- Consider implementing client-side quota management
- May need to implement request prioritization
